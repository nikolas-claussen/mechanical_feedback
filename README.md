# mechanical_feedback
Code for the investiagtion of mechanical feedback in the Drosophila embryo, written in python. So far, there are two modules which can 
- compute Lie derivatives  
- transport tensor fields along path lines of a vector field
For each module, there is also a series of tests to confirm their correct functioning.

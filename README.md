# mechanical_feedback
Code for the investiagtion of mechanical feedback in the Drosophila embryo, written in python. So far, there are three modules which can 
- detect line segments in an image using the radon transform, and use this to compute anisotropy tensors 
- transport tensor fields along path lines of a vector field
- compute Lie derivatives

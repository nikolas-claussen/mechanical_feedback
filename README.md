# mechanical_feedback
Code for the investiagtion of mechanical feedback in the Drosophila embryo, written in python. So far, there are three modules which can 
- compute Lie derivatives  
- transport tensor fields along path lines of a vector field
- compute anisotropy tensors using the radon transform method
For each module, there is also a series of tests to confirm their correct functioning.
